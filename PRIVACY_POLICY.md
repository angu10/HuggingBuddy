Privacy Policy for HuggingBuddy Chrome Extension

Last updated: 04/24/2024

Introduction
------------

HuggingBuddy is a Chrome extension designed to enhance the reading experience of research papers on the Hugging Face website. This privacy policy explains how HuggingBuddy handles user data and ensures the privacy and security of its users.

Data Collection
---------------

HuggingBuddy does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or user data. The extension operates locally within the user's browser and does not send any data to external servers or third parties.

Permissions
-----------

HuggingBuddy requires the following permissions to function properly:

1. "activeTab": This permission allows HuggingBuddy to access the currently active tab in the Chrome browser when the user interacts with the extension. It is used to detect when the user is viewing a research paper on the Hugging Face website and to inject the necessary content scripts.

2. "storage": This permission enables HuggingBuddy to store and retrieve non-personal data, such as user preferences and settings, using the Chrome storage API. This data is stored locally on the user's device and is not transmitted to any external servers.

3. "tabs": The "tabs" permission allows HuggingBuddy to interact with and modify the tabs in the Chrome browser. It is used to open new tabs, update tab URLs, and facilitate communication between the extension's background script and content scripts.

4. "scripting": This permission enables HuggingBuddy to execute its content scripts on the Hugging Face research paper pages. The content scripts are responsible for modifying the page's DOM, adding the "View Summary" button, and displaying the generated summaries and related questions.

Third-Party APIs
----------------

HuggingBuddy integrates with the Gemini API, a language model developed by Google, to generate summaries, questions, and answers related to the research papers. However, the extension does not share any user data with the Gemini API. The communication with the API is limited to sending the necessary text content of the research papers and receiving the generated summaries and questions.

Data Usage
----------

HuggingBuddy uses the permissions and accesses the research paper content solely for the purpose of providing its core features, such as generating summaries, questions, and enhancing the reading experience. The extension does not collect, store, or transmit any user data beyond what is necessary for its functionality.

Data Sharing
------------

HuggingBuddy does not share any user data with third parties. The extension operates independently and does not transmit any information to external servers or services, except for the limited communication with the Gemini API as described above.

Data Security
-------------

HuggingBuddy takes the security of user data seriously. The extension uses industry-standard security measures to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the data it handles. However, since HuggingBuddy does not collect or store any personal information, there is minimal risk to user privacy.

Changes to this Privacy Policy
------------------------------

We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We encourage users to periodically review this policy for any updates. Continued use of HuggingBuddy after any modifications to the privacy policy constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
